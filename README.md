# NixOS-Configuration
TODOs:

* Run Plasma Commands on Startup to ensure panel position, clock widget, dolphin theme, breezedark, clickItemTo open

* Remap Plasma CTRL+ALT+T to Kitty, if possible

* Let kwalletd6 run in TTY and QTile as well
- It seems it doesn't like to be run in a Qt-free environment, but right now it doesn't work on QTile either

* Neovim Config - If possible, configurable per devshell-flake
** telescope, nvim-cmp, language servers, formatters, treesitter, tokyonight, filetree

* Implement all apps
